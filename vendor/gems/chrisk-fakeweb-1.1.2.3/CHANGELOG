fakeweb (development)

  [ Chris Kampmeier ]
  * sort query params before storing internally, so that
    http://example.com/?a=1&b=2 and http://example.com/?b=2&a=1 are considered
    the same URL (although this is technically incorrect, it's much more
    convenient--most web apps work that way, and Net::HTTP's use of a hash to
    pass query params means that the order in which FakeWeb stores them can be
    unpredictable)
  * add support for ports in URLs, so that http://example.com/ and
    http://example.com:3000/ are not the same
  * fix for non-faked SSL requests failing with "Unable to create local socket"
  * update Rakefile to fix warning about deprecated code
